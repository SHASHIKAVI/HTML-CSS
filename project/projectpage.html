        Chhatrapathi Shivaji Maharaj: A Legacy Carved in Stone Chhatrapathi
        Shivaji Maharaj, a revered figure in India, was a 17th-century warrior
        who carved a Maratha empire from the Deccan plateau. Born in 1630, his
        youth was steeped in military training and tales of Hindu epics. He
        displayed his brilliance early, capturing forts and challenging the
        dominant powers of the Bijapur Sultanate. Shivaji's genius lay not just
        in battlefield valor but also in innovative tactics. Guerilla warfare,
        swift raids, and the use of mountain forts as strongholds became his
        hallmarks. He established a well-organized and loyal army, the Marathas,
        known for their mobility and light cavalry. His 1674 coronation at
        Raigad Fort marked the formal birth of the Maratha Empire. Beyond
        military might, Shivaji was a just and progressive ruler, promoting
        religious tolerance and a fair administrative system. He is remembered
        as a symbol of Hindu resistance against Mughal rule and a champion of
        Swaraj, or self-rule. His legacy continues to inspire, making him a
        national hero in India.

      <h2 class="kindoms">Chhatrapathi's kindoms</h2>
      <p>
        Shivaji Maharaj didn't conquer entire kingdoms through war, but rather
        laid the foundation for the Maratha Empire. <br />
        <strong>Foundation:</strong> He primarily carved out his territory from
        the declining Adilshahi Sultanate of Bijapur through strategic conquests
        of forts and surrounding areas. <br /><strong>Warfare:</strong> His
        military brilliance and guerilla tactics helped him win several key
        battles, expanding Maratha influence. <br />
        <strong>Legacy:</strong>This expansion through warfare wasn't about
        conquering entire kingdoms, but establishing a strong base for the
        future Maratha Empire. It's difficult to pinpoint an exact number of
        kingdoms "won" by war since his focus was on strategic land acquisition,
        not complete domination.

      <h2 class="hindu">Why Shivaji is called Symbol of Hindu Resistance?</h2>
      <p>
        Shivaji Maharaj is called a symbol of Hindu resistance for a few key
        reasons:

        <strong>Challenged Mughal Rule:</strong>The Mughal Empire, which ruled
        much of India during Shivaji's time, was Muslim-dominated. His victories
        against the Mughals, particularly early raids and conquests, were seen
        as a pushback against their rule and a defense of Hindu kingdoms.
        <br /><strong>Hindu Identity:</strong>Shivaji's rise coincided with a
        period of Hindu kingdoms being weakened by Muslim powers. His assertion
        of Hindu identity and establishment of a strong Hindu kingdom resonated
        with the populace. <br /><strong>Rekindled Hindu Pride:</strong>His
        innovative military tactics and victories over larger forces inspired
        Hindus and boosted their morale. He is seen as a figure who stood up to
        foreign domination. While Shivaji is a Hindu hero, his rule was marked
        by religious tolerance. He respected other faiths and had Muslims in his
        army.His resistance was primarily against Mughal expansion, not against
        Muslims in general. <br />
        <br />Overall, Shivaji Maharaj's defiance against the powerful Mughals,
        his promotion of Hindu identity during a challenging time, and his
        military success made him a symbol of Hindu resistance for many.
